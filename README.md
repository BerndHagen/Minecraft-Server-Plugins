## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Minecraft server 1.21 or higher (Spigot, Paper, or compatible fork)
- Java 17 or newer (Java 21 recommended)
- (Optional) Vault for economy features, LuckPerms or PermissionsEx for permissions, MySQL for advanced database support

### **Installation Steps**
1. Download the latest plugin `.jar` files from the [Releases](https://github.com/BerndHagen/Minecraft-Server-Plugins/releases) page.
2. Stop your Minecraft server if it is running.
3. Copy the downloaded `.jar` files into your server's `plugins` folder.
4. (Optional) Add Vault, LuckPerms, or other dependencies to the `plugins` folder if needed.
5. Start your server again.

### **First Launch & Configuration**
- On first start, each plugin will generate its own configuration files in the `plugins/PluginName/` directory.
- Edit these config files as needed, or use in-game commands for setup (see plugin sections below).

### **Verifying Installation**
- Use `/plugins` in-game to check if the plugins are loaded and active.
- Use `/version <PluginName>` to check the version and status of each plugin.
- If a plugin does not load, check the server console for error messages (e.g., missing dependencies or wrong Java version).

For plugin-specific commands and advanced configuration, see the sections below.

## **Piston Crusher**

An automation plugin that allows pistons to crush only whitelisted blocks into multiple items, with a configurable multiplier. All settings can be changed live via command, no server restart required.

### Core Features:
- **Block Whitelist:** Only allowed blocks are crushed (configurable)
- **Output Multiplier:** Sets how many items are dropped per block
- **Crusher Block:** Must be movable by pistons (e.g., no obsidian, bedrock, etc.)
- **Tab Completion:** Available for all material names

### Example Setup

To build a working piston crusher, arrange the blocks in a straight line as follows:

```
[Piston] [Block to be crushed] [Crusher Block]
```

**How it works:**
- When the piston extends, it pushes the block to be crushed into the crusher block
- If the block to be crushed is on the whitelist, it will be destroyed and drop multiplied items according to the plugin settings
- The piston must be facing directly toward the block to be crushed, which is then directly adjacent to the crusher block

Make sure there is nothing blocking the piston from pushing the block into the crusher block. Only blocks on the whitelist will be crushed and multiplied.

### Administrative Commands:
| Command | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `/pistoncrusher whitelist add <Material>` | Adds a block to the whitelist |
| `/pistoncrusher whitelist remove <Material>` | Removes a block from the whitelist |
| `/pistoncrusher whitelist list` | Shows all allowed blocks |
| `/pistoncrusher multiplier <Value>` | Sets the multiplier (e.g. 2.5) |
| `/pistoncrusher multiplier` | Shows the current multiplier |
| `/pistoncrusher crusherblock <Material>` | Sets the crusher block |
| `/pistoncrusher crusherblock` | Shows the current crusher block |

**Note:** Material names must be valid (`cobblestone`, `gold_block`, ...). Multiplier â‰¥ 1.0. Changes take effect immediately.
