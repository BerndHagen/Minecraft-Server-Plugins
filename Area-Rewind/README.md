## Overview

AreaRewind is a powerful Minecraft plugin that allows server administrators and players to protect, manage, and restore areas in their world. It features an intuitive GUI, robust backup/restore capabilities, and fine-grained permissions for collaborative play.

## Features

- **Protected Areas**: Create, manage, and delete protected regions.
- **Backups**: Create backups of areas, restore previous states, preview and compare backups, undo/redo changes.
- **Enhanced GUI System**: Comprehensive graphical interface with:
  - Main menu with categorized access to all features
  - Area management with creation wizard and quick actions
  - Advanced backup management with visual timeline
  - Permission and trust management interfaces
  - Visualization controls and boundary editing
  - Import/export functionality
  - Administrative tools and settings
- **Permissions**: Fine-grained permission system for all plugin features, including area creation, deletion, backup, restore, trust management, visualization, import/export, and GUI access.
- **Trusted Players**: Manage trusted players for each area.
- **Visualization**: Visualize area boundaries and states.
- **Import/Export**: Export and import area data for portability. Either drag into folders, or use the /rewind export command to export to a WorldEdit schematic file.
- **WorldEdit Integration**: Enhanced functionality if WorldEdit is present.

## Project Structure & Customization

Below is a guide to the main components of the plugin and where to modify each part:

- **Modern GUI System:**

  - Location: `src/main/java/arearewind/gui/`
    - `EnhancedGUIManager.java`: Coordinates the new GUI system
    - `utils/`: Base classes, item builders, and GUI utilities
    - `menus/`: Specific menu implementations for different features
  - Description: Comprehensive graphical interface system providing intuitive access to all plugin features. The new system includes a main menu, area management with creation wizards, advanced backup management, permission interfaces, and administrative tools. All functionality is accessible through easy-to-navigate menus with visual feedback and confirmation dialogs.

- **GUI Manager (Integration Layer):**

  - Location: `src/main/java/arearewind/managers/GUIManager.java`
  - Description: Clean integration layer that delegates to the enhanced GUI system while maintaining backwards compatibility. All legacy GUI code has been removed in favor of the modern, modular approach.

- **Core Functionality:**

  - Location: `src/main/java/arearewind/managers/`
    - `AreaManager.java`: Area creation, management, and logic
    - `BackupManager.java`: Backup and restore logic
    - `PermissionManager.java`: Permission checks and management
    - `FileManager.java`, `IntervalManager.java`, `VisualizationManager.java`: Supporting features
  - Description: These files implement the main logic for area protection, backup, permissions, and other features. Edit these to change how the plugin works internally.

- **Commands:**

  - Location: `src/main/java/arearewind/commands/CommandHandler.java`
  - Description: Handles all `/rewind` commands and their subcommands. Modify here to add, remove, or change command behavior.

- **Data Models:**

  - Location: `src/main/java/arearewind/data/`
  - Description: Classes representing protected areas, backups, and block info. Change these to adjust how data is stored and managed.

- **Configuration:**

  - Location: `src/main/resources/config.yml`
  - Description: Main plugin configuration file. Adjust settings, defaults, and options here.

- **Plugin Metadata & Permissions:**

  - Location: `src/main/resources/plugin.yml`
  - Description: Defines plugin name, version, commands, and permissions. Edit to change command registration and permission nodes.

- **Build Output:**
  - Location: `target/Area-Rewind-<version>.jar`
  - Description: The compiled plugin JAR to deploy on your server.

Refer to these locations when customizing or extending the plugin for your server's needs.
